 
                         === RHash program ===

RHash is a console utility for calculation and verification of magnet links
and a wide range of hash sums like CRC32, MD4, MD5, SHA1, SHA256, SHA512,
AICH, ED2K, Tiger, DC++ TTH, BitTorrent BTIH, GOST R 34.11-94, RIPEMD-160,
HAS-160, EDON-R, Whirlpool and Snefru.

Hash sums are used to ensure and verify integrity of large volumes of data
for a long-term storing or transferring.

Features:
 * Output in a predefined (SFV, BSD-like) or a user-defined format.
 * Can calculate Magnet links and EDonkey 2000 links.
 * Updating hash files (adding hash sums of files missing in the hash file).
 * Ability to process directories recursively.
 * Portability: the program works the same on Linux, *BSD or Windows.


                      === The LibRHash library ===

LibRHash is a professional, portable, thread-safe C library for computing
a wide variety of hash sums, such as CRC32, MD4, MD5, SHA1, SHA256, SHA512,
AICH, ED2K, Tiger, DC++ TTH, BitTorrent BTIH, GOST R 34.11-94, RIPEMD-160
HAS-160, EDON-R, Whirlpool and Snefru.
Hash sums are used to ensure and verify integrity of large volumes of data
for a long-term storing or transferring.

Features:
 * Small and easy to learn interface.
 * Hi-level and Low-level API.
 * Allows calculating of several hash functions simultaniously.
 * Portability: the library works on Linux, *BSD and Windows.
